# ideacatalyst
My own web implementation of Approximately The Thing From The Future. Now working! npm install -g imagineer

This will supply a random Subject, Object, Era, and Mood, and then the user generates an idea that fits. Mash ideas together to create a better world!


Play around with the work in progress: https://jsfiddle.net/kaqustub/9/
